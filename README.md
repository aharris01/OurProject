## Working with Remotes
## Working Locally
### Important concepts I have learned about working locally with git
1. "**git status**" can be used to see the active branch, if it's updated, and if there's anything to commit.
2. git can be used to keep track of **file versions**, and does not have to be used in conjuction with a remote repository.
3. **Branches** can be made using "git branch <branch name>".
4. The workflow for working locally consists of transfering fields between the **workspace, staging, and local repository**.
5. The staging and local repository are **virtual "places" git creates and tracks**. They are not normal directories like the workspace.
